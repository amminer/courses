## Course Policies

### Late Work Policy

No late work will be accepted without prior discussion. I understand that life happens, but request for late hand-in must be submitted prior to the due date. Permission will be granted dependent upon reasons, current state of completion, etc.

### Incompletes
Incomplete (I) grades will be granted only in emergency cases (usually only for a death in the family, major illness or injury, or birth/adoption of a child), and if the student has turned in 90% of the points possible AT THE TIME OF REQUEST. In other words, if you have been keeping up, but a major life event occurs, let me know as soon as possible. If you are having any difficulty that might prevent you completing the coursework, please don’t wait until the end of the term; let me know right away.

## Academic or Student Support Services

### Accommodations

Accommodations for students with disabilities are determined and approved by Disability Resource Center (DRC). If you, as a student, believe you are eligible for accommodations but have not obtained approval please contact DRC immediately at 503-725-4150, drc@pdx.edu, or https://www.pdx.edu/disability-resource-center. DRC notifies students and faculty members of approved academic accommodations and coordinates implementation of those accommodations. If you have accommodations through DRC and wish to take the Midterm or Final Exam in the testing center, I strongly recommend that you schedule it before the end of week 1. If you are not registered with the DRC, you cannot register to take an exam in the testing center.

I want to make this class an open and welcoming environment for all. Your success is my goal.

### Religious Observance

Portland State University strives to respect all religious practices. If you have religious holidays that conflict with any of the requirements of this class, please see me immediately so that we can make alternative arrangements.

### Reach Out for Success

The PSU [Center for Student Health and Counseling (SHAC)](https://www.pdx.edu/health-counseling/) is staffed with folks who care and can help with a wide range of personal challenges. Here at PSU, there is never a need to tough things out alone.  

As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student’s ability to participate in daily activities. PSU is committed to advancing the mental health and well-being of its students. If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available. You can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via SHAC https://www.pdx.edu/health-counseling/.

SHAC also has resources for physical health, including flu shots. You can check out their COVID-19 resources page here: https://www.pdx.edu/health-counseling/covid-19-resources (including testing).

[Get Food Now](https://www.pdx.edu/student-access-center/food-assistance) Here at PSU, there is never a need to tough things out alone. Those who can, give, so those who need, have.

[Housing / financial crisis help](https://www.pdx.edu/dean-student-life/student-homelessness-and-economic-crisis) Here at PSU, there is never a need to tough things out alone. Emergency Housing, etc.

These reports help PSU understand what students and employees are experiencing on and around campus and provide support where needed.
